1. What Frontend Mentor is
    Site that provides differing levels of challenges
    Owned by Matt Studdert
    You build your solution to the challenge using any means that you wish (straight HTML/CSS/JavaScript, or React, Svelte and so on)
1. What do you get
    base files
    style sheet
    paid: figma and sketch
1. on completing a challenge
    You submit the challenge
    Other people can then see your solution
    slide to compare desktop version against the design image
    see any questions you have asked
    can provide comments
    points
1. Peer review
    Other people who either go directly to your challenge page, or have completed the challenge themselves can see your solution
    they can provide comments, like your solution, bookmark it
1. My thoughts & experience
    what do I like
        find it very useful
        great for building your skills
    what do I dislike
        it can be like the blind leading the blind. Its odd to be offering advice / tips when you are learning and likewise from others
        sometimes no comments or advice
    improvements?
