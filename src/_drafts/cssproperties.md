Frontend Mentor

I’ve be rattling off some Frontend Mentor challenges recently. Aiming to finish all the newbie challenges before moving onto Junior and onwards.

One thing I’ve noticed is that I’ve really embraced CSS properties, probably too much so :)

In my last couple of challenges I’ve had upwards of 50 properties. They cover typography, Colors, positioning, styling and padding / margins.

For instance in this [Product] challenge …

The theory being that it makes it easy to retheme or to switch up details for the desktop version compared to the mobile version without having to redo X, Y or Z classes.

To me it makes sense. The code stays the same, you’re just tweaking the variables passed in.
