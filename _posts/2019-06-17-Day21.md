Day 21 of trip 

Day FrÃ³mista to CarriÃ³n de los Condes. 18.88km according to app. 19.18km with Phone GPS (minor detour). Was walking quickly. Which Fitbit doesnâ€™t like ðŸ™‚

Weather: pleasant to warm
Terrain/: pretty damn flat, easy going 

Shocked I only woke at 6:40, was hard to get to sleep 

Bolted along. A little over 5.5km an hour for 3 hours 26 minutes, with only 4 minutes rest / stopping for photos.

It was a very boring walk, weirdly not many on the path, only passed a handful. Road was very long and straight, walking right beside it virtually the whole way. (I missed that there was an alt route). It kind of does the head in after a while. Esp when Fields are mostly yellow and only bits of green.

Arrived way to early at Albergue. While they let me in at 10:50, I wasnâ€™t able to check in Iâ€™ll 11:30 (I was first). 

Was left confused a couple of times when a nun came and asked me a question only in Spanish. Thankfully google translate eventually saved me (she wanted to know if a blanket was mine).

Lovely place, and 6â‚¬ for a single bed was great.

After showering, washing clothes and stuff I wandered around the corner and had a breakfast at 1pm â€ªÂ¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯â€¬ 

Then met up with Erica, Ben, Karen & Susan for lunch (nice paella but seemed expensive). Showed them the ad for a horse & cart ride to the next village/town which interested them.

After that I just ambled around a bit, visited the supermarket & got bits for tomorrow.

I spent a bit of the afternoon hiding in the dining area away from the heat and honestly from people too. Had been feeling moody/moopy all day and didnâ€™t fancy really interacting.

In the evening I attended fully my first mass of the trip, had a pilgrims blessing and was given a paper star to carry with me.

After church I ambled some more and I bumped into Ben, Susan & Karen again. Like a bad penny I keep turning up. We talked for a bit & got a class of wine (with a small free tortilla snack) and I got Ben to reserve me a spot on this horse & cart.

While itâ€™s now 20â‚¬ and not the 15â‚¬ on the digital book Iâ€™m using, itâ€™s seems like a unique thing to do. I could get the bus if I _really_ wanted, or Iâ€™m happy to walk the 17km stretch to the next town â€¦ but this is different.

I dashed back to make sure I was in for 21:30 just in case they closed the gate early. As it is when the nuns came to check in at 22:05, 3 people where missing from the room. One arrived at 22:24, the others are still missing.

From what Iâ€™ve read some of the albergues here are shut and wonâ€™t let you in. So no idea what is going to happen for the missing 2.
