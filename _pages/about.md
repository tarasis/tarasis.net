# Me 

Personal blog of Robert McGovern, until 2020 I was principally a stay at home dad but in my free time I was a Mac & iOS developer, former programmer, sys-admin, tech editor, book reviewer & writer. You can see more details about that on LinkedIn.

I can be found many places online, mostly with the username **tarasis**, but also **duemoko**. Links can be found in the sidebar, although they'll likely move here in the future :)

# Site

Site is built with Jekyll but I use the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme. I've incorporated tweaks by [Jun](jun711.github.io) to add the [rainbow progress bar](https://jun711.github.io/web/add-scroll-progress-bar-to-a-website-to-indicate-read-progress/), and the [scroll to top](https://jun711.github.io/web/adding-scroll-to-top-button-to-a-website/) button. 

There are custom tweaks to the CSS used in the Neon theme provided by Minimal Mistakes, both for general site appearance but also to the syntax highlighting.
