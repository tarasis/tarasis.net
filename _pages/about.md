Personal blog of Robert McGovern, I'm principally a stay at home dad. Also a wannabe Mac & iOS developer, programmer, sys-admin, tech editor, book reviewer & writer.

I can be found many places online, mostly with the username **tarasis**, but also **duemoko**. Links can be found in the sidebar, although they'll likely move here in the future :)
